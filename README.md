List of third party libraries

- SwiftyRestKit
A simple, protocol-oriented way, to simplify REST requests on iOS. This library was created by me , more info and documentation can be found at: https://github.com/rroca1982/SwiftyRestKit

- SegueReusableViewHelper
A protocol-oriented way, to deal with reusable views, segue handling and instantiation through storyboard ids without having loose literal strings throughout your code. This library was also created by me, more info and documentation can be found at: https://github.com/rroca1982/SegueReusableViewHelper

Both libraries are available through CocoaPods, but since they are my own projects and I have everything at hand, I decided to add them manually to this project, to avoid any possible CocoaPods issues that may arise with different versions of XCode. I chose not to use any other libraries that I might use in other projects for the same reason.
